Gesture recognition to solve CAPTCHAs
CAPTCHA can be solved by human beings only and not by bots and thus helps in stopping hackers and especially their crawlers also called spiders from acceding un-perplexed areas of the net. CAPTCHAs used till date have now become time-consuming and need more human efforts so that program could not crack it and this has become a major issue to consider as lead to time wastage. This paper has proposed a better model to generate CAPTCHA with the help of hand gesture recognition techniques which is more efficient than the traditional CAPTCHAs.
